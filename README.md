# CUSTOMER-CHURN-PREDICTION

The project aims to predict customer churn using a logistic regression model. The dataset used for training and evaluation is loaded from a CSV file named 'Churn_Modelling.csv' using the pandas library. The dataset contains information about customers, such as their credit score, geography, gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products, credit card status, activity status, and estimated salary, along with an "Exited" column indicating whether the customer has churned or not.
The code begins by importing the necessary modules, including seaborn, numpy, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot, for data analysis and visualization. The data is then loaded into a DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv()` function.
Data preprocessing is performed next. The `dropna()` function is used to remove any rows with missing values from the dataset. Three columns, namely 'RowNumber', 'Exited', and 'Surname', are dropped from the features as they are deemed unnecessary for the churn prediction task. The target variable 'Exited' is separated from the features and stored in the variable 'y'.
Further preprocessing involves converting categorical variables into binary dummy variables using one-hot encoding. The 'Geography' and 'Gender' columns are one-hot encoded using the `pd.get_dummies()` function with the `drop_first=True` parameter.
Data visualization is then performed using seaborn. A count plot is created to show the distribution of churned and non-churned customers. Additionally, a pie chart represents the gender distribution among customers.
The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split()` function from scikit-learn. The features ('x_train' and 'x_test') and the target variable ('y_train' and 'y_test') are split with a 70% training and 30% testing ratio.
A logistic regression model is chosen for training using the `LogisticRegression()` class from scikit-learn. The model is trained on the training data using the `fit()` method.
Model evaluation is performed by making predictions on both the training and testing data. The accuracy of the model is calculated using the `accuracy_score()` function from scikit-learn's metrics module. The accuracy scores for both the training and testing data are printed, providing an understanding of how well the model is performing in classifying customer churn.
Overall, this project focuses on customer churn prediction using a logistic regression model, starting from data loading and preprocessing, followed by model training and evaluation.
